# Beacon Monitor-2 Project

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%202--Clause-orange.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)

This is software to monitor 'NCDXF/IARU International Beacon Project'
stations by Raspberry Pi and SoftRock SDR receiver.  Please also refer
http://www.ncdxf.org/beacon/

After the statement on the web site (http://ayoko.net/beacon/) on
March, 2017, the progress was quite slow until this November.
Sorry for your patience so far.

## Installation

Please refer [installation document](./doc/installation.md).

Currently, this software is provided as a beta version.  It still
requires clean-up work.

## Troubleshooting

Please refer [common troubleshooting](./doc/troubleshooting.md).

Alternatively, you can post your questions to [Issues](https://github.com/yokoyama-flogics/ibp_monitor_2/issues) page.
I will check it as soon as possible.

## Web site

- My own monitor station: http://ayoko.net/beacon

- Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/beaconmonitor2/

- Project background (in Japanese): http://flogics.com/wp/ja/2017/11/beaconmonitor2-available/

## Some notices

My main receiver for Beacon Monitor is SoftRock and PCM2902 USB CODEC
adapter, so I'm focusing on it.  I'm also considering RTL-SDR dongle
and SpyVerter, and also recently announced AirSpy HF+.

## Missing functionality

Functionality which are not implemented yet though there were in the
previous Monitor-1 site is:

- Map Visualizer (gnomonic projection mapping)

- Twitter bot

Thank you for your additional patience...

Regards,

Atsushi Yokoyama (JN1SDD)
